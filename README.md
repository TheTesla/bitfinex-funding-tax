# Calculate bitfinex funding rewards in EUR for tax

You have to setup your alphavantage apikey in ``apikey.py`` and your bitfinex api credentials by calling: 

```bash
export BFX\_KEY=yourkey 
export BFX_SECRET=yoursecret
```

then call:

```bash
python3 getfunding.py
```

This program is currently a dirty mess. Change your parameters in source code.
